665,"Principal Content Management Consultant (Physician Editor, UpToDate) - Endocrinology","UpToDate® (www.uptodate.com) is an electronic clinical decision support resource for physicians and patients that provides current medical information in a format accessible via computer, smartphone, or tablet. UpToDate is part of Wolters Kluwer Health, an international corporation that provides tools to assist professionals in healthcare, finance, and accounting. More than 850,000 clinicians in 164 countries and more than 90% of academic medical centers in the U.S. rely on UpToDate, and more than 60 research studies confirm UpToDate’s widespread usage and association with improved patient care and hospital performance, including reductions in length of stay, adverse complications, and mortality. The Principal Content Management Consultant – Physician Editor, Endocrinology position requires an 80 to 90% FTE commitment, a broad understanding of clinical issues, and an interest in analyzing the literature. For the right person, this is a unique opportunity to impact the practice of medicine throughout the U.S. and around the world. Physician editors ensure that topics address the important clinical questions that arise when diagnosing or managing a specific disorder, present information clearly and succinctly, and provide evidence-based and actionable recommendations for care. Extensive editorial training is provided to help the editor learn critical skills for evaluating the literature and creating content in the UpToDate style. Training is overseen by at least two senior physician editors. All new topics are read and reviewed by the training editors until the new physician editor achieves a satisfactory level of independence.

The Endocrinology Physician Editor can be trained remotely and can work from anywhere in the United States. However, work hours should significantly overlap with standard work hours in the Eastern time zone to allow for regular interaction with other physician editors. Editing requires 80 to 90% FTE. In the remaining 10 to 20% time, most physician editors remain involved in teaching and/or patient care activities, using their clinical experience to help ensure the content of the program is maximally useful at the point of care. Thus, the position provides the opportunity to remain clinically active, while spending the majority of your time interpreting the literature and discussing the impact of new research on clinical practice with our expert contributors.

Essential Duties and Responsibilities:
Principal Content Management Consultants (Physician Editors) review and edit the new contributions from our external expert authors to make sure they address the questions that a practicing clinician might have. Topics must contain specific and actionable recommendations and describe the supporting evidence. Updating is an equally important component of the work and is usually initiated by the physician editor, who is responsible for monitoring the literature for new developments and identifying topics that need updating. Physician editors also systematically review existing topics for clarity, completeness, and clinical relevance. This work is not done in isolation. UpToDate editors work closely with outside authors, section editors, editors-in-chief, and peer reviewers to ensure the material is accurate and free of bias. In addition, in-house editorial and graphics assistants work with the physician editors to produce and maintain each topic.

Qualifications:

Required Education:
· Medical Degree
· Board Certification/Eligibility in Endocrinology

Preferred Experience, Knowledge, and Abilities:
· Impeccable communication skills: verbal, writing, and listening
· Ability to work collaboratively with colleagues at different skill levels
· Excellent organizational and time management skills
· Ability to give and receive feedback effectively
· Interest in critical analysis of the medical literature (skills can be learned on the job)
